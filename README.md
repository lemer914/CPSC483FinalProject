# CPSC483FinalProject
I have uploaded all 5 Notebooks I was using to do my project, which are: OGB_FPGNN.ipynb, OGB_GCN_Baseline.ipynb, TUD_GCN_Baseline.ipynb, TUD_GMT.ipynb, and Dataset_Analysis.ipynb. In these notebooks I do the following tasks: <br><br>
OGB_FPGNN.ipynb: implement FP-GNN on OGB datasets (ToxCast and ClinTox)<br>
OGB_GCN_Baseline.ipynb: implement GCN Baseline on OGB datasets<br>
TUD_GCN_Baseline.ipynb: implement GCN baseline on TUDatasets (PROTEINS and DD)<br>
TUD_GMT.ipynb: implement GMT on TUDatasets<br>
Dataset_Analysis.ipynb: analyze datasets, compute mean plus standard error of test metrics<br><br>
I uploaded all of the datasets during my sessions in Colab, so I do not have any downloaded dataset files to include with this code. For this reason, I would recommend running my code in Colab or in a notebook in general, since that is how I worked on the project and I know it runs well that way.
# Running script file
I have also uploaded a script file called cpsc483finalprojectscript.py containing all of the tasks in one place. I have not tried running it since I edited it down from my Notebooks, but it seems like it should work, although the paths I used to upload my datasets may need to be changed if not in Google Colab. There are no command line arguments needed. The dependencies are in Requirements.txt.
# Running full Notebook
I also uploaded CPSC483FinalProjectFullNotebook.ipynb, which is a notebook containing every task in one cell. I'm not sure if that would be easier to run than the individual notebooks or the script file, but I included it in case that works best.
